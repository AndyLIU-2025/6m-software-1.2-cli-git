                    <h1>Introductions</h1>
                        <p>Hello, my name is Andy Liu. I bring over 20 years of experience in the semiconductor industry, 
                            where I held various technical and managerial roles across multiple global companies. 
                            My career has given me a strong foundation in engineering, project management, 
                            and cross-functional collaboration, especially in high-tech environments 
                            where innovation and precision are key.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I am pursuing further studies at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, 
                            majoring in Software Engineering. 
                            This new academic journey represents my passion for continuous learning and adapting to 
                            the evolving technology landscape. My current focus is on web development, 
                            with hands-on experience in setting up websites, including frontend and backend development, 
                            as well as deployment and optimization.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Through this transition, I aim to bridge my deep semiconductor background with modern software technologies, 
                            enabling me to contribute to tech solutions that integrate both hardware and software effectively. 
                            I enjoy working in diverse, fast-paced environments and am always eager to take on new challenges 
                            that drive personal and professional growth.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Looking ahead, I am excited to explore opportunities where I can apply my combined expertise to 
                            build impactful digital solutions and contribute to innovative projects.
                        </p>
